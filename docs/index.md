## Acknowledgements

I want to thank my house plants for providing me with
a negligible amount of oxygen each day. Also, I want
to thank the sun for providing more than half of their
nourishment free of charge.

???+ warning

    `TAInstCalorimetry` has been developed without involvement
    of *TA Instruments* and is thus independent from the company 
    and its software.
